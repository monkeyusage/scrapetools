# scrapetools

A small wrapper around aiohttp that lets developers use their scraperapi account to make requests

To use it you should save your API_KEY inside your environment variable with the name "scraperapi_proxy".


The library exposes the fetch functions from both:

    - the default scrapetools lib -> which is async
    - the sync scapetools lib -> from scrapetools.sync


Clone it and install it using "pip install ."

Contributions are welcome!
